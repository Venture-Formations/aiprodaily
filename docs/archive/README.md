# Archived Documentation

_Last updated: 2025-11-28_

This folder contains historical documentation that was relevant during initial development but is no longer needed for day-to-day operations.

## Why These Are Archived

- **Implementation guides** - Document "how we built it" rather than "how to use it"
- **Migration guides** - One-time migrations that are now complete
- **Status/session notes** - Development progress tracking, not operational docs

## Folder Structure

```
archive/
├── implementations/   # Feature implementation guides (complete)
├── migrations/        # Database and code migration guides (complete)
└── status/            # Development session notes
```

## If You Need These

These docs are preserved for historical reference. If you need to understand:
- **How a feature was built** → Check `implementations/`
- **How migrations were done** → Check `migrations/`
- **What was discussed in old sessions** → Check `status/`
