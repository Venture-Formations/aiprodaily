The provider then calls the SSO Token Exchange endpoint with the sent code and receives the OIDC token. They log the user in based on this token and redirects the user back to the Vercel account using deep-link parameters included the redirectLoginUrl. Providers should not persist the returned `id_token` in a database since the token will expire. See [**Authentication with SSO**](https://vercel.com/docs/integrations/create-integration/marketplace-api#authentication-with-sso) for more details.

It supports both free and paid billing plans with automatic authorization creation for paid resources. ## How it works 1. Validates the integration configuration and product 2. For free resources: Auto-discovers available free billing plans 3. For paid resources: Creates billing authorization inline using provided billingPlanId 4. Provisions real resources through the Vercel Marketplace 5. Returns the created store with connection details ## Workflow Before using this endpoint, discover available products and billing plans: 1. List your configurations: `GET /v1/integrations/configurations` 2. Get products for a configuration: `GET /v1/integrations/configuration/{id}/products` 3. Get billing plans for a product: `GET /integrations/integration/{integrationId}/products/{productId}/plans` 4. Review the `metadataSchema` for each product to understand required metadata 5. Create storage with discovered product: `POST /v1/storage/stores/integration/direct` ## Usage Patterns - **Free resources**: Omit `billingPlanId` - endpoint will auto-discover free plans - **Paid resources**: Provide `billingPlanId` from billing plans discovery - **Prepayment plans**: Also provide `prepaymentAmountCents` for variable amount plans ## Limitations - **Admin access required**: Only integration configuration admins can create stores - **Storage limits apply**: Subject to your team's storage quotas - **Payment method required**: For paid plans, ensure valid payment method is configured ## Error Responses - `400 Bad Request`: Invalid input, no plans available, or billing issues - `403 Forbidden`: Insufficient permissions (non-admin users) - `404 Not Found`: Integration configuration or product not found - `429 Too Many Requests`: Rate limit exceeded
- [Delete an integration configuration](https://vercel.mintlify-docs-rest-api-reference.com/docs/rest-api/reference/endpoints/integrations/delete-an-integration-configuration.md): Allows to remove the configuration with the `id` provided in the parameters. The configuration and all of its resources will be removed. This includes Webhooks, LogDrains and Project Env variables.

Use this endpoint to discover what integration products are available for your integration configuration. The returned product IDs or slugs can then be used with storage provisioning endpoints like `POST /v1/storage/stores/integration/direct`. ## Workflow 1. Get your integration configurations: `GET /v1/integrations/configurations` 2. **Use this endpoint**: Get products for a configuration: `GET /v1/integrations/configuration/{id}/products` 3. Create storage resource: `POST /v1/storage/stores/integration/direct` ## Response Returns an array of products with their IDs, slugs, names, supported protocols, and metadata requirements. Each product represents a different type of resource you can provision. The `metadataSchema` field contains a JSON Schema that defines: - **Required metadata**: Fields that must be provided during storage creation - **Optional metadata**: Fields that can be provided but are not mandatory - **Field validation**: Data types, allowed values, and constraints Use this schema to validate metadata before calling the storage creation endpoint.

Vercel is expected to use `list-resources` and other read APIs to get the new state.<br/> <br/> `resource.updated` event should be dispatched when any state of a resource linked to Vercel is modified by the partner.<br/> `installation.updated` event should be dispatched when an installation's billing plan is changed via the provider instead of Vercel.<br/> <br/> Resource update use cases: <br/> <br/> - The user renames a database in the partner’s application. The partner should dispatch a `resource.updated` event to notify Vercel to update the resource in Vercel’s datastores.<br/> - A resource has been suspended due to a lack of use.
