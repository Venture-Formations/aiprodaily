## 🚀 Immediate Tasks (Once Deployed)

### 1. Initialize Article Lookback Hours Settings
**Endpoint:** `https://aiprodaily.vercel.app/api/debug/add-lookback-columns`
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED - Created 2 settings successfully (after fix)

**Purpose:** Creates database settings for article lookback feature

**Expected Result:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Created 2 settings: primary_article_lookback_hours, secondary_article_lookback_hours",
  "results": {
    "primary_exists": false,
    "secondary_exists": false,
    "created": ["primary_article_lookback_hours", "secondary_article_lookback_hours"]
  }
}
```

**Defaults Created:**
- `primary_article_lookback_hours`: 72 (3 days)
- `secondary_article_lookback_hours`: 36 (1.5 days)

**Verify:** Go to Settings > Email > Article Lookback Hours - should show 72/36

---

### 2. Initialize Subject Line AI Prompt
**Endpoint:** `https://aiprodaily.vercel.app/api/debug/init-subject-line-prompt`
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED - Prompt created successfully

**Purpose:** Creates editable subject line prompt in database

**Expected Result:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Subject line prompt initialized successfully",
  "action": "created"
}
```

**Verify:** Go to Settings > AI Prompts > Newsletter category - should see "Subject Line" prompt

---

### 3. Initialize Article Title/Body Prompts
**Endpoint:** `https://aiprodaily.vercel.app/api/debug/split-article-prompts`
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED - All 4 prompts created successfully

**Purpose:** Creates separate title and body prompts for article generation

**Expected Result:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Created 4 prompts successfully",
  "results": {
    "primary_title_created": true,
    "primary_body_created": true,
    "secondary_title_created": true,
    "secondary_body_created": true,
    "errors": []
  }
}
```

**Defaults Created:**
- `ai_prompt_primary_article_title`: Generates engaging headlines (6-12 words)
- `ai_prompt_primary_article_body`: Generates newsletter content (40-75 words)
- `ai_prompt_secondary_article_title`: Generates engaging headlines (6-12 words)
- `ai_prompt_secondary_article_body`: Generates newsletter content (75-150 words)

**Verify:** Go to Settings > AI Prompts - should see new prompts (after UI reorganization)

**Note:** Article generation now uses a two-step process:
1. Generate title first using title prompt
2. Generate body using body prompt with the generated title
3. Falls back to legacy single-step articleWriter if needed

### 4. Test Criteria Weights Independence
**Steps:**
1. Go to Settings > AI Prompts
2. Find Primary Evaluation Criteria section
3. Edit weight for Criteria 1 (e.g., change to 2.5)
4. Save
5. Scroll to Secondary Evaluation Criteria section
6. Verify Criteria 1 weight is still 1.0 (not 2.5)

**Expected:** Primary and Secondary weights are independent

## 🔍 Testing Recommendations

### Test Article Lookback Feature
1. Check current campaign articles before RSS processing
2. Note the created_at timestamps
3. Run manual RSS processing
4. Verify articles selected from full lookback window (not just today)
5. Confirm highest-rated articles were chosen regardless of age

### Test Subject Line Customization
1. Go to Settings > AI Prompts > Newsletter
2. Find Subject Line prompt
3. Modify the prompt (e.g., change character limit from 40 to 35)
4. Save changes
5. Generate a new subject line for a campaign
6. Verify the change took effect

### Test Article Title/Body Generation
1. Run RSS processing or manually create articles
2. Check Vercel function logs for "Generating primary/secondary article title..."
3. Verify logs show "Generated title:" followed by the headline
4. Verify logs show "Generated body: X words"
5. Check that generated articles have engaging, non-generic titles
6. Confirm article bodies are within word count limits (40-75 or 75-150)
7. Test fallback: Temporarily rename a prompt in database, verify fallback works

## ⚠️ Known Issues / Notes

1. **Vercel Platform Error:** Original deployment failed with "An unexpected error happened when running this build." This is a Vercel infrastructure issue, not a code problem. Local builds succeed.

2. **First-Time RSS Processing:** After initializing lookback hours, the first RSS processing will use the new logic. Expect different article selections compared to previous runs.

3. **Existing Criteria Weights:** If you've previously set criteria weights, they apply to BOTH primary and secondary. After this update:
   - Existing weights remain as primary weights
   - Secondary weights start at 1.0 (default)
   - You can now customize them independently
4. **UI Reorganization:** ✅ COMPLETED (Commit `47c84d6`)
   - Settings > AI Prompts page reorganized with improved layout
   - "Primary Article Prompts" section now shows Evaluation Criteria + Article Title + Article Body prompts
   - "Secondary Article Prompts" section now shows Evaluation Criteria + Article Title + Article Body prompts
   - Eliminated duplicate "Secondary Article Prompts" heading
   - Title/Body prompts appear in their respective sections as expected
