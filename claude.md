- **Error Tracking**: Enhanced endpoint with detailed error reporting for each child table deletion
- **Comprehensive Cleanup**: Handles all 12 related tables in correct deletion order
- **Non-Blocking Design**: Child table deletion errors don't stop the overall process
- **Detailed Logging**: Returns `child_deletion_errors` object showing exactly which tables failed

#### 2. **AI Prompt Testing System**
- **Test Endpoint**: Created `/api/debug/test-ai-prompts` with realistic St. Cloud data
- **UI Integration**: Purple "Test Prompt" button on each prompt card
- **Realistic Test Data**: Pre-populated with St. Cloud-specific content for each prompt type
- **New Tab Opening**: Tests open in separate browser tab for easy comparison

#### 3. **Custom AI Prompt Defaults**
- **Database Schema**: Added `custom_default` TEXT column to `app_settings` table
- **Save as Default**: Green button with double confirmation to save current prompt
- **Smart Reset**: Prioritizes user's custom default over original code defaults
- **User Feedback**: Clear messages indicating which default was used during reset
- **Migration Helper**: Created `/api/debug/add-custom-default-column` endpoint

#### 4. **Event Population Integration**
- **Auto-Population**: Events now populate automatically during RSS processing
- **No Manual Steps**: Removed need to manually select events for each campaign
- **Smart Selection**: Up to 8 events per day with featured event logic

### Technical Implementation Details

#### Campaign Deletion Tables (Complete List):
```
1. campaign_events
2. articles
3. rss_posts
4. road_work_data
5. road_work_items (THE MISSING TABLE - fixed in this session)
6. road_work_selections
7. campaign_dining_selections
8. campaign_vrbo_selections
9. user_activities
10. archived_articles
11. archived_rss_posts
12. newsletter_campaigns (parent table)
```

#### Error Tracking Enhancement:
```typescript
// Now returns detailed error information
{
  "error": "Failed to delete campaign",
  "details": "update or delete on table...",
  "code": "23503",
  "child_deletion_errors": {
    "road_work_items": {
      "message": "Foreign key constraint violation",
      "code": "23503"
    }
  }
}
```

#### Custom Defaults API Flow:
```
Save as Default:
POST /api/settings/ai-prompts
{ key: "ai_prompt_...", action: "save_as_default" }
‚Üí Saves current value to custom_default column

Reset to Default:
POST /api/settings/ai-prompts
{ key: "ai_prompt_..." }
‚Üí Checks custom_default first
‚Üí Falls back to code default if none
‚Üí Returns which default was used
```

### Session Problem Solving

#### Issue 1: Campaign Deletion 500 Error
- **Symptoms**: Persistent "Failed to delete campaign" error
- **Root Cause**: `road_work_items` table had foreign key constraint on campaign_id
- **Investigation**: Added error tracking to see which child table deletions were failing
- **Solution**: Added `road_work_items` table to deletion sequence
- **Iterations**: Discovered and added 4 additional tables (road_work_items, campaign_dining_selections, campaign_vrbo_selections, archived tables)

#### Issue 2: Events Not Populating
- **Symptoms**: Manually created campaigns had no events selected
- **Root Cause**: Event population only ran via cron, not during RSS processing
- **Solution**: Integrated `populateEventsForCampaignSmart()` into RSS processor workflow

#### Issue 3: TypeScript Compilation Errors
- **Symptoms**: Build failures after AI_PROMPTS became async
- **Root Cause**: Debug endpoints missing `await` keywords
- **Solution**: Added `await` to all AI_PROMPTS function calls

### Current System Capabilities

#### Campaign Management:
- **Full Lifecycle**: Create ‚Üí Populate Events ‚Üí Process RSS ‚Üí Generate Articles ‚Üí Review ‚Üí Send ‚Üí Delete
- **Robust Deletion**: Handles all related tables with comprehensive error tracking
- **Auto-Population**: Events automatically selected during RSS processing

#### AI Prompt Management:
- **Testing**: One-click testing with realistic data
- **Customization**: Save personalized defaults with confirmation
- **Reset Options**: Choose between custom defaults and original code defaults
- **Error Prevention**: Double confirmations on destructive actions

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL DEVELOPMENT RULES

### Confidence and Clarification Policy
**When uncertain or confidence is below 80%, always ask the user for clarification:**
- ‚ùå **NEVER** proceed with assumptions when uncertain about requirements, implementation approach, or potential impacts
- ‚úÖ **ALWAYS** ask for clarification, guidance, or more context when confidence is below 80%
- ‚úÖ **PREFER** multiple choice format when asking for clarification to make decisions easier
- ‚úÖ Present 2-4 concrete options with pros/cons to help user make informed decisions

**Example - Multiple Choice Clarification:**
```
I'm not certain about the best approach for handling X. Here are the options:

A) Approach 1: [Description]
   Pros: [List benefits]
   Cons: [List drawbacks]

B) Approach 2: [Description]
   Pros: [List benefits]
   Cons: [List drawbacks]

C) Approach 3: [Description]
   Pros: [List benefits]
   Cons: [List drawbacks]

Which approach would you prefer, or would you like me to explain any option in more detail?
```

### Date/Time Handling Policy
**ALL date and time operations MUST use local (non-UTC) comparisons:**
- ‚ùå **NEVER** use `.toISOString()`, `.toUTCString()`, or UTC-based Date methods for date comparisons
- ‚úÖ **ALWAYS** extract date strings directly (e.g., `date.split('T')[0]`) to avoid timezone shifts
- ‚úÖ **ALWAYS** use local time for filtering, sorting, and displaying dates
- ‚úÖ When comparing dates, use string comparison on YYYY-MM-DD format without timezone conversion

**Why:** UTC conversion causes dates to shift forward/backward depending on timezone, breaking filters and comparisons.

**Example - CORRECT:**
```typescript
const eventDate = event.start_date.split('T')[0] // "2025-10-10"
return eventDate === selectedDate
```

**Example - INCORRECT:**
```typescript
const eventDate = new Date(event.start_date).toISOString().split('T')[0] // May shift to "2025-10-09" or "2025-10-11"
return eventDate === selectedDate
```

## üîç Previous Session Issues (Historical Context)

### 1. Events Not Populating in Campaigns
- **Issue**: RSS processing completing successfully but no events showing in campaigns
- **Root Cause**: RSS processing timing out before reaching event population step
- **Investigation**: Manual "Process RSS Feed" completed in 3 minutes vs 12-minute timeout
- **Discovery**: Event population happened at END of RSS processing and was being skipped

### 2. Subject Line Generation Failing
- **Issue**: Subject lines not generating during both manual and scheduled RSS processing
- **Root Cause**: AI returning JSON format but code expecting plain text
- **Error**: `d.trim is not a function` when trying to call `.trim()` on JSON object
- **Discovery**: `callOpenAI` returns `{raw: content}` when JSON parsing fails

### 3. RSS Processing Workflow Analysis
- **Manual Processing**: Works in 3 minutes, includes articles but no events/subject lines
- **Scheduled Processing**: Takes 10+ minutes, includes 60-second delays, more complex workflow
- **Schedule Restrictions**: `ScheduleChecker.shouldRunRSSProcessing()` blocking execution

## ‚úÖ Session 5 Fixes Implemented

### 1. Smart Event Population System (`rss-processor.ts`)
- **Revolutionary Change**: Events now populate FIRST, before RSS processing starts
- **Smart Random Selection**: Up to 8 events per day with intelligent featured event logic
- **Campaign Date-Based**: Uses campaign.date (not creation time) for 3-day event range
- **Preserves Existing**: Doesn't overwrite existing event selections, only adds new ones
- **Featured Logic**: Only one featured event per day, preserves existing featured events

### 2. Subject Line Generation Timing Optimization
- **Critical Move**: Subject line now generates immediately after top 5 articles are activated
- **Removed 60-Second Delay**: Eliminated unnecessary wait time that wasted timeout
- **Works for Both**: Manual and scheduled RSS processing now generate subject lines
- **Faster Workflow**: Subject lines generated in 3-4 minutes instead of 10+ minutes

### 3. Subject Line Response Format Fix (`openai.ts`)
- **Root Cause Fix**: Changed AI prompt from JSON format to plain text response
- **Simplified Parsing**: Removed complex JSON parsing that was causing errors
- **Consistent Output**: Now generates clean subject lines like "St. Cloud Rallies To Block Leaves"
- **Error Elimination**: Fixed `d.trim is not a function` error completely

### 4. RSS Processing Workflow Optimization
- **New Order**: Events ‚Üí RSS Processing ‚Üí Article Activation ‚Üí Subject Generation ‚Üí Continue
- **Timeout Management**: Reduced from 15 to 12 minutes but moved critical steps earlier
- **Manual Button Enhanced**: Now includes both event population and subject generation
- **Reliability**: Critical steps happen early when function has full timeout available

## üõ†Ô∏è Session 5 Debug Tools Created

## üìù Current Session Notes (Auto-Added Before Condensing)

### Sept 22, 2025 - Session 4: Complete Newsletter Automation Implementation

## üÜï Major Issues Resolved

### 1. Facebook Image Processing (COMPLETED ‚úÖ)
**Root Cause**: Facebook CDN URLs contain temporary authentication tokens that expire quickly
- Facebook URLs like `https://scontent-*.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/...&oe=66F0B9E4` contain expiration parameters
- These URLs become inaccessible within hours, causing broken images in newsletters

**Solution Implemented**:
- **RSS Processing Enhancement**: Added immediate Facebook image detection and re-hosting during RSS feed processing
- **GitHub Storage Integration**: Downloads Facebook images in real-time and uploads to GitHub repository
- **Fallback Protection**: Preview generation now filters out expired Facebook URLs with `&oe=` parameters
- **Enhanced Error Handling**: Better logging for failed downloads and Facebook-specific error messages

### 2. Automatic Event Population (COMPLETED ‚úÖ)
**Root Cause**: Events were never automatically populated during RSS processing - required manual intervention
- Campaigns showed no events in Local Events section
- Manual selection needed for every campaign

**Solution Implemented**:
- **Auto-Population Logic**: Added `populateEventsForCampaign()` method to RSS processor
- **Date Range Calculation**: Uses same 3-day Central Time logic as preview generation
- **Smart Selection**: Auto-selects up to 6 events per day, sorted by start time
- **Featured Events**: First event of each day automatically set as featured
- **Integration**: Seamlessly integrated into RSS processing workflow

### 3. Subject Line Generation Fix (COMPLETED ‚úÖ)
**Root Cause**: Database query mismatch - looking for `ai_score` field that doesn't exist
- Code expected `articles.ai_score` but actual data structure uses `articles.rss_post.post_rating.total_score`
- Subject line generation was failing silently because no "top" article was found

**Solution Implemented**:
- **Database Query Fix**: Updated RSS processing route to query proper scoring fields
- **Sorting Logic**: Fixed article sorting to use `rss_post?.post_rating?.[0]?.total_score`
- **Enhanced Logging**: Added detailed debugging for which article is selected for subject generation

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation Details

### Facebook Image Processing Flow
```
RSS Feed ‚Üí Extract Image URL ‚Üí Detect Facebook CDN ‚Üí Download Immediately ‚Üí Upload to GitHub ‚Üí Update Database
```

### Event Population Workflow
```
RSS Processing Complete ‚Üí Calculate 3-Day Date Range ‚Üí Query Available Events ‚Üí Auto-Select Top 6/Day ‚Üí Insert Campaign Events
```

### Subject Line Generation Fix
```
Campaign Query ‚Üí Include post_ratings ‚Üí Sort by total_score ‚Üí Select Top Article ‚Üí Generate Subject Line
```

## üöß Deployment Challenges Resolved
Multiple TypeScript compilation errors encountered and fixed:
1. **Duplicate Function Error**: Removed duplicate `logInfo` and `logError` functions
2. **Missing Function Error**: Restored accidentally removed `logError` function
3. **Type Inference Issues**: Fixed campaign-events debug endpoint type errors

## üéØ Current Status: FULLY FUNCTIONAL
**Next automated RSS run will include all features:**
- ‚úÖ Facebook images converted to GitHub-hosted copies
- ‚úÖ Events automatically selected and featured
- ‚úÖ AI subject lines generated from top-rated articles
- ‚úÖ Complete newsletters created without manual intervention

### Sept 22, 2025 - Session 3: Vercel Cron Authentication & RSS Processing Integration

## üÜï Major Updates

### RSS Processing Integration with Subject Line Generation (COMPLETED ‚úÖ)
- **Successfully integrated** AI subject line generation into RSS processing workflow
- **Added 60-second delay** after RSS processing before subject line generation
- **Removed standalone** `generate-subject` cron job from vercel.json
- **Increased timeout** from 300 to 420 seconds for RSS processing route
- **Updated ScheduleChecker** to reflect integrated workflow in display

### Vercel Cron Authentication Issues Fixed (COMPLETED ‚úÖ)
- **Root Cause**: Vercel cron jobs make GET requests by default, but routes expected POST with Authorization headers
- **Failed Solution**: Tried adding `method: "POST"` and `headers` to vercel.json (not supported by Vercel)
- **Working Solution**: Updated routes to handle GET requests from Vercel cron without authentication
- **Detection Logic**: Routes now distinguish between Vercel cron (no secret) vs manual testing (with secret)

### Routes Updated for Cron Compatibility:
1. **RSS Processing Route** (`/api/cron/rss-processing`):
   - Added GET handler that duplicates full POST functionality
   - Handles both Vercel cron and manual testing with secret parameter
   - Includes full RSS processing + 60-second delay + AI subject line generation

2. **Create Campaign Route** (`/api/cron/create-campaign`):
   - Fixed 401 Unauthorized error by adding GET handler
   - Now properly authenticates with Vercel cron requests
   - Maintains manual testing capability

### UI/UX Improvements (COMPLETED ‚úÖ)
- **Time Selector Enhancement**:
  - Converted all time selectors to 12-hour format with AM/PM dropdowns
  - Added proper 15-minute increments (00, 15, 30, 45) for cron compatibility
  - Added 5-minute increments for scheduled send times
  - Fixed AM/PM dropdown width (w-16 to w-20) to prevent text cutoff
  - Added custom CSS for right-aligned dropdown arrows

- **Review Workflow Documentation**:
  - Updated Settings > Email > Review Workflow Overview
  - Removed separate "Generate AI subject line" step
  - Integrated AI subject line generation into step 1 description
  - Fixed hardcoded "9pm" reference to use dynamic scheduled send time

### Live Testing Results (WORKING ‚úÖ)
**10:45 AM Cron Logs:**
- ‚úÖ RSS Processing: 200 Success - "RSS Processing check: Current CT time 10:45, Scheduled: 10:45"
- ‚ùå Create Campaign: 401 Unauthorized (fixed with latest deployment)
- ‚úÖ Health Check: 200 Success
- ‚úÖ Send Final: 200 Success (but was just returning status, now properly checks schedule)

### Technical Achievements
- **Authentication Working**: RSS processing now authenticates and runs at scheduled time
- **Time Matching**: System correctly detects 10:45 AM cron within 15-minute window of 10:15 AM setting
- **Integration Success**: Subject line generation happens automatically after RSS processing
- **Deployment Ready**: All cron routes now compatible with Vercel's GET-based cron system

### Current Status
- **RSS Processing**: ‚úÖ Working with integrated subject line generation
- **Campaign Creation**: ‚úÖ Fixed authentication, ready for testing
- **User Testing**: User adjusting run times to test full workflow
- **System State**: All major cron authentication issues resolved

## üîÑ Content Management Protocol

**CLAUDE.MD AS PRIMARY REPOSITORY:**
- This file (claude.md) is now the main content repository for all development notes
- SESSION_NOTES.md is deprecated in favor of this centralized approach
- All session activities should be documented here in real-time

**AUTOMATIC UPDATE PROTOCOL:**
- **BEFORE CONDENSING**: Always add current session notes to the "Current Session Notes" section above
- **After Adding**: Update the "Last Updated" timestamp
- **Then Proceed**: With condensing operations while preserving all historical context

**Document Maintenance:**
1. Add new issues/resolutions as they arise directly to this file
2. Update timestamps for each session
3. Use debug endpoints to verify current state
4. Commit changes for future reference
5. **CRITICAL**: Current session notes auto-added before condensing
