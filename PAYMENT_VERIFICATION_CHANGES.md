# Payment Verification System - Implementation Summary

## üéØ Problem Solved

**Before:** Paid event submissions were NOT being added to the database. Customers paid but received nothing. No webhook verification existed.

**After:** Complete payment verification system ensures only successfully paid events are added to the database.

---

## üìÅ Files Created

### 1. Database Migration
- **File:** `database_migration_pending_submissions.sql`
- **Purpose:** Creates `pending_event_submissions` table for temporary storage
- **Action Required:** Run in Supabase SQL Editor

### 2. Stripe Webhook Handler
- **File:** `src/app/api/webhooks/stripe/route.ts`
- **Purpose:** Receives Stripe webhook events and processes payments
- **Features:**
  - Signature verification for security
  - Inserts events after payment confirmation
  - Sends Slack notifications
  - Marks pending submissions as processed

### 3. Payment Verification Endpoint
- **File:** `src/app/api/events/verify-payment/route.ts`
- **Purpose:** Backup verification called by success page
- **Features:**
  - Checks payment status
  - Shows pending/processed state
  - Handles webhook delays gracefully

### 4. Cleanup Cron Job
- **File:** `src/app/api/cron/cleanup-pending-submissions/route.ts`
- **Purpose:** Removes expired pending submissions (24+ hours old)
- **Schedule:** Daily at 2:00 AM CT

### 5. Setup Documentation
- **File:** `STRIPE_PAYMENT_SETUP.md`
- **Purpose:** Complete deployment and testing guide
- **Contents:**
  - Database setup instructions
  - Stripe configuration steps
  - Environment variables
  - Testing procedures
  - Troubleshooting guide

## üìù Files Modified

### 1. Database Types
- **File:** `src/types/database.ts`
- **Changes:**
  - Added payment fields to `Event` interface
  - Created `PendingEventSubmission` interface

### 2. Checkout Endpoint
- **File:** `src/app/api/events/create-checkout/route.ts`
- **Changes:**
  - Now stores pending events in database before Stripe redirect
  - Added submitter validation
  - Enhanced logging

### 3. Vercel Configuration
- **File:** `vercel.json`
- **Changes:**
  - Added cleanup cron job schedule (2:00 AM daily)
  - Added timeout configuration for cleanup job

## üîê Environment Variables Required

Add these to Vercel environment variables:

```bash
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_xxxxx  # From Stripe Dashboard ‚Üí API Keys
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_xxxxx  # From Stripe Dashboard ‚Üí Webhooks
```

**Note:** `STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` may already exist in your client-side code. If not, add it.

## üîÑ Payment Flow (New)

```
1. User fills out event form
   ‚Üì
2. Adds to cart and clicks "Pay with Stripe"
   ‚Üì
3. POST /api/events/create-checkout
   - Creates Stripe checkout session
   - Stores event data in pending_event_submissions table
   ‚Üì
4. User redirected to Stripe checkout page
   ‚Üì
5. User completes payment
   ‚Üì
6. Stripe sends webhook to /api/webhooks/stripe
   - Verifies webhook signature
   - Retrieves pending submission
   - Inserts events into events table
   - Sends Slack notification
   - Marks submission as processed
   ‚Üì
7. Stripe redirects user to /events/success?session_id={ID}
   ‚Üì
8. Success page calls /api/events/verify-payment
   - Shows payment confirmation
   - Displays event count
   ‚Üì
9. Cart cleared, success message shown
```

---

## üîç Key Security Features

1. **Webhook Signature Verification:** HMAC SHA256 validation prevents fake webhooks
2. **No Client-Side Trust:** Success page cannot trigger event creation
3. **Database Validation:** Duplicate processing prevented with `processed` flag
4. **Automatic Cleanup:** Expired submissions removed after 24 hours
5. **Comprehensive Logging:** All actions logged for audit trail

## ‚úÖ Testing Checklist

Before deployment, verify:

- [ ] Run database migration in Supabase
- [ ] Add environment variables to Vercel
- [ ] Create webhook endpoint in Stripe Dashboard
- [ ] Deploy to Vercel
- [ ] Test with Stripe test card: `4242 4242 4242 4242`
- [ ] Verify events appear in database
- [ ] Confirm Slack notification received
- [ ] Check success page shows correct message
- [ ] Test cleanup cron job manually

## üö® Critical Deployment Steps

### 1. Database Setup (MUST DO FIRST)
```sql
-- Run this in Supabase SQL Editor
-- File: database_migration_pending_submissions.sql
```

### 2. Environment Variables
```bash
# Add to Vercel ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_xxxxx
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_xxxxx
```

### 3. Stripe Webhook Configuration
1. Stripe Dashboard ‚Üí Developers ‚Üí Webhooks
2. Add endpoint: `https://st-cloud-scoop.vercel.app/api/webhooks/stripe`
3. Select event: `checkout.session.completed`
4. Copy signing secret to environment variables

### 4. Deploy to Vercel
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add payment verification system"
git push
```

### 5. Test End-to-End
Use test card `4242 4242 4242 4242` to verify complete flow.

---

## üìä Monitoring

### Check Webhook Status
Stripe Dashboard ‚Üí Webhooks ‚Üí Your Endpoint ‚Üí Events

### Check Database
```sql
-- Recent paid events
SELECT * FROM events
WHERE payment_status = 'completed'
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- Pending submissions (should be empty after webhook)
SELECT * FROM pending_event_submissions
WHERE NOT processed;
```

### Check Vercel Logs
```
[Checkout] Created pending submission for session: cs_test_xxxxx
[Webhook] Received event: checkout.session.completed
[Webhook] Successfully processed 1 events
```

## üêõ Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "Webhook signature verification failed"
**Solution:** Verify `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` matches Stripe Dashboard signing secret

### Issue: Events not appearing after payment
**Solution:**
1. Check Vercel logs for webhook errors
2. Manually resend webhook from Stripe Dashboard
3. Verify pending_event_submissions table exists

### Issue: Duplicate events created
**Solution:** Check webhook isn't firing twice. Verify `processed` flag logic.

## üìû Next Steps After Deployment

1. **Test in Stripe Test Mode:**
   - Use test card `4242 4242 4242 4242`
   - Verify complete flow works
   - Check database and Slack notifications

2. **Switch to Live Mode:**
   - Update environment variables with live keys
   - Create live webhook endpoint
   - Test with real payment method (small amount)

3. **Monitor for 24 Hours:**
   - Watch Vercel logs for any errors
   - Verify webhook processing successful
   - Check cleanup cron job runs

**Implementation Date:** October 1, 2025
**Status:** Ready for Testing
**Next Action:** Run database migration and configure Stripe webhook
